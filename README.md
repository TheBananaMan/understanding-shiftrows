# Introduction
This is the github repository for our CT-RSA 2015 paper "Analyzing Permutations for AES-like Ciphers: Understanding ShiftRows". Here, you will find the source code written in C++, which has been used to generate the results for the paper.

The tool is for determining optimal rotation parameters for AES-like ciphers. This is obtained by brute-forcing over what we in the paper call a "rotation matrix normal form", which represents a class of equivalent rotation parameters for the cipher. The tool assumes an existing installation of IBM ILOG CPLEX on the system. However, the code can, with little effort, be modified to work with a different solver.
